        <li>1 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>1/2 pound bay scallops</li>
        <li>1/2 pound medium shrimp</li>
        <li>1 cup snow peas</li>

    </ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-low heat. Add leek and garlic; cook and stir until soft, about 5 minutes. Add rice and cook for 5 minutes more, stirring frequently.</li>
        <li>Pour in 1 1/2 cups chicken broth and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes, continuing to stir occasionally. Pour in remaining chicken broth and wine; increase heat to medium and cook for about 5 more minutes, stirring constantly.</li>
        <li>Add scallops, shrimp, peas, and red pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until remaining liquid is almost absorbed and seafood has cooked, about 5 minutes. When rice is just tender and slightly creamy, season with Parmesan cheese, basil, lemon juice, and pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Enjoy</strong></li>
